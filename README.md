Code for demo visualizations utilizing data on the Edo State Open Data Portal

This is a basic website established to demonstrate the use-cases of open data, based on data published to the Edo State Open Data Portal.

The maps were made using Tilemill, a free tool for beautifully designing maps using Carto, a language similar to CSS.

The map tiles are hosted by Mapbox, which provides a suite of hosting services, including free hosting.
